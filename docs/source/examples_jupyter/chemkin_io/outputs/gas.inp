!Gas-phase reactions. The rate constant expression is:
!k = kb/h * (T)^beta * exp(-Ea/RT)
!Each line has 4 columns:
!- Reaction reactants and products separated by <=>
!- Preexponential factor, kb/h
!- Beta (power to raise T in rate constant expression)
!- Ea (Activation Energy or Gibbs energy of activation in kcal/mol
